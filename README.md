# <Prework Study Guide webpage>

## Description

I created this webpage to practice my new coding skills using my new knowledge of HTML, CSS. Git, and JavaScript. I also built it to house all of the important information I learned during my prework. If I lose my physical notes I will still have my notes webpage.

## Usage

To use this webpage, all you need to do is find the section you want notes for and read the bullet points underneath it. You can also open Chrome DevTools and get a suggestion on what to study first.
